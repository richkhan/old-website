                <h2>I am an Entreprenuer.</h2>
                <p>I am CEO of two start up companies. <a href="http://www.luriklabs.com">Lurik Labs</a> and <a href="http://www.luriklabs.com/academy">Lurik Academy</a>. I was inspired to start Lurik Labs with a couple of my friends after my research internship. My topic was Using VR to Improve Learning about Ecosystem. During the research process I realized how the combination of education with VR can assist in learning many topics from the STEM fields. I decided to use what I learned from my first research,(A Framework for Measuring Creativity in Collaborative Digital Spaces) about design based research and game based learning to be integrated into a VR environment. The goal is to create a fully simulated world in VR.
                Since I like gaming I want to teach game development and as a result promote game based learning. Hence the second company Lurik Academy.

                <p>I have been interested in VR since middle school. I loved the the idea for being immersed 
                    in a fully simulated computer generated world that I can do anything I want, create anything 
                    I want, and become anything I want. As a result when I did my Research Internship and I was 
                    able to choose my topic of interest, I chose VR. I presented my research poster at the end of 
                    the internship at a Symposium, which was well received. (check out the poster board now!)

                <h2>I am a Software Engineer</h2>
                <p>When I entered college I was a Biology major with the aim going to medical school. 
                    However, in the back of my mind I wanted to program, create and build systems, and 
                    of course create simulated worlds. So after some thought I switch over to Computer Science, 
                    at first it was a challenge, however I began to enjoy the many different aspects of computer science. From low level assembly language, to high level C++, Java, and Python. I enjoyed learning how things worked and figuring out solution to difficult problems. When learning Java I enjoyed how straightforward it was to pick up. I learned how to learn a new programming language in my Java journey. My goal is to become graphics programmer.  (check out my github!)

                <p>
                    As a gamer and having an interesting in building system. I picked up Game Development in the beginning of my college career. I taught myself the Unity3d Game Engine. I loved to program and understand game mechanics with javascript and C#. Currently I oversee development of games made by Lurik Labs.
